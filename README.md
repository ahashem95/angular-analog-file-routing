# Angular, Vite, and File-based routes

This is an example application that uses Angular, Analog, and Vite for file-based routing.

Routes are places in the `pages` folder as default exports. Additional route configuration can be added by using a `.config.ts` file with the same name as the route.

## Setup

Run `yarn` to install the application dependencies.

## Development

Run `yarn dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Test

Run `yarn test` to run unit tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev).
